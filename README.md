This is my Minor 2 project 
Hey guys,
Its me Uttam Kumar velentena
Guys its a minor project In which simply I am assigned with any name and i have to create image of the name 
So in the problem it was mentioned that need to create the image only using loops in python no function or library is allowed 
so i have used only loops and if else 

just import code in your vs code and run it . The code will run and result in printing image using ascii code
